# Falling-Stick

![Falling stick](https://github.com/HeyHeyPlane/Computational-Physics/blob/main/Falling-Stick/falling_stick.png)

- Derived the Lagrangian of a fallin stick
- Numerically calculated the time the stick takes to fall down
- Checked the numerical computation experimentally, and confirmed it

### Future work
- Add table of contents
- Redo the experiment with more data points, and use three different sticks
- Add a more detalied explanation of the numerical computation
- Develope a web application where a user can enter the lenght of a stick, and get the time it will take it to fall down
